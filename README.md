# TicTacToe
This is a game of TicTacToe! I followed a tutorial from the internet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7tfvpkw0I
The account is Bro Code and they do a great job, thanks for the help!
After completion, I added a few things to the program: color coordination and a reset button. 
This is my second Java practice program!
